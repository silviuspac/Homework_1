The script.py file contains all the scripts submitted by me. There are all of them in numeric order.

The submissions.pdf file contains the screens of submissions page on my profile.

P.S. Some of the exercises may seem incomplete. That's because part of the script (the main) was already given by Hackerrank and it was not available in the submission to copy.
